Its NFC Tagger demo app

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology for short-range wireless devices to share data with other devices or trigger actions on those devices. Built using a radio frequency field, it allows devices that donâ€™t have any power to store small pieces of data while also enabling other powered devices to read that data.

Write standard information to an NFC tag.
Read that information.
Save custom information to a tag.
Modify the data already found on a tag.
